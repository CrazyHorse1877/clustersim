TO INSTALL THE EXTENSION
------------------------
Copy fginterface.jar and FGInterface.properties to $NetLogoIntallDir/extensions/fginterface 
creating directories as necessary.


TO RUN THE DEMO
----------------
1. Open the NetLogo project FGInterfaceDemo.nlogo
2. Start as many Flight Gear instances as required, on the same machine or one connected
   via LAN. NOTE: The --telnet=<port number> option must be specified for the interface
   to communicate with flight gear.
3. Set the number-of-fg-instances in Net Logo according to the number of instances 
   started.
4. In the flight-gear-interface-properties window in Net Logo, specify the name and 
   telnet port number of each of the flight gear instances:
    a. Only lines without a # symbol at their beginning will have any effect.
    b. Set the properties as <name>=<server-name>:<port number> (some examples are 
       pre-populated) where <name> is only for your reference and <server-name> is the
       DNS name (or IP address) of the flight gear instance.
5. Ensure the control flight gear switch is set to ON
6. Click the setup button, you should see each of the flight gear instances take off and
   begin to gain altitude.
7. Wait for the craft to reach cruising altitude, then push the go button. This will 
   begin the Net Logo simulation, which will in turn
   control the flight gear instances.

NOTE: I included a perl script in the src folder which I used to launch two Flight Gear instances
      on my local machine. If you want to use this it will need some modification, because I made a
      custom airport called VG001 which is located on the Village Green. Other modifications would
      also be necessary depending on you OS install location etc.
